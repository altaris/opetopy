# Introduction

This project is the Python implementation of the opetope derivation systems
presented in **Type theoretical approaches to opetopes**, by [Pierre-Louis Curien](https://www.irif.fr/~curien/), [CÃ©dric Ho Thanh](https://chothanh.wordpress.com/), and [Samuel Mimram](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Samuel.Mimram/).

# Documentation

Available at [readthedocs.io](https://readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest).

Generating the documentation requires [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/). After running

```sh
    make doc
```

the HTML documentation should be located at `doc/build/html/index.html`.

# Tests

Unit tests are written in [UnitTests.py](UnitTests.py), and can executed by running

```sh
    make unittests
```

A [code coverage report](https://pypi.org/project/coverage/) can be generated by running

```sh
    make coverage
```

The report should then be located at `htmlcov/index.html`. Additionaly, the code can be typechecked with [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) (according to [PEP484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/)) by running

```sh
    make typecheck
```
